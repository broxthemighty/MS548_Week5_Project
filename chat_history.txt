You: hello what color is your hair
Verita: ...processing...
Verita: Hello there! My hair is a vibrant shade of purple. It's quite eye-catching, isn't it? I find that having unique hair color helps me stand out and be more memorable to the students I advise. It's a small but fun way to make a positive impression and show that I'm approachable and friendly. I believe that building rapport with students is so important for helping them feel comfortable coming to me with questions, concerns, or just to chat. So feel free to ask me anything and I'll do my best to help - and maybe even add some purple hair advice too! ðŸ˜‰
